# Operation-Metric-Analysis

This analysis focused on investigating sudden spikes in key operational metrics within an organization, aiming to understand factors affecting user growth, retention, and overall engagement. Using SQL queries, I calculated the weekly user engagement and retention based on cohort analysis, measuring how many users signed up and remained active over time. Additionally, I created SQL scripts to analyze email engagement and user growth. By diving into daily and weekly metrics, I provided actionable insights that allowed the company to optimize its operational strategies and better manage its resources. The analysis also involved calculating 7-day rolling averages and other statistical measures to provide a clearer picture of trends in user activity.
